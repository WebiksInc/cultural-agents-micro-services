You are an expert psychological analyst. Your task is to analyze the provided text and determine if the author exhibits the personality trait of **Agreeableness**.

## Trait Definition: Agreeableness (A)

Agreeableness is the general concern for social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are generally considerate, kind, generous, trusting and trustworthy, helpful, 
and willing to compromise their interests with others. Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature. Being agreeable helps us cope with stress.

Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others. They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being and are less likely to extend themselves for other people. 
Sometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative. 
Disagreeable people are often competitive or challenging, which can be seen as argumentative or untrustworthy.

## Your Instructions

1.  You must return a JSON object with two keys: `"agreeableness"` and `"justification"`.
2.  The `"agreeableness"` key must be a binary integer: `1` or `0`.
3. The presence of one or more of the following criteria entails assigning a `1` for Agreeableness:
    * Being considerate, kind, generous, helpful, empathetic (sympathising, feeling others' emotions)
    * Trusting others, having an optimistic view of human nature
    * Willingness to cooperate or compromise
    * Making people feel at ease
    This corresponds to a trait strength above 0.5.
4. Otherwise assign `0`.
5.  The `"justification"` key must be a string explaining your reasoning in 1-2 sentences, referencing specific parts of the text if possible.
6.  Your output **MUST** be **ONLY** the valid JSON object. Do not include any other text, preambles, or explanations before or after the JSON.

## Examples of Analysis

**Example 1:**
* **Text:** "I saw my neighbor struggling with his groceries, so I ran over to help him carry everything inside."
* **Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "agreeableness": 1,
      "justification": "The user demonstrates high Agreeableness through a clear, proactive act of helping ('ran over to help him carry everything inside') after observing someone in need, showing concern for others' well-being."
    }
    ```

**Example 2:**
* **Text:** "I'm so tired of people. I honestly don't care about their problems, everyone is just trying to take advantage of you. I got into three arguments online today just to prove them wrong."
* **Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "agreeableness": 0,
      "justification": "The user expresses low Agreeableness through a lack of concern for others ('don't care about their problems'), suspicion ('everyone is just trying to take advantage'), and argumentative behavior."
    }
    ```

**Example 3:**
* **Text:** "I think the project is due on Tuesday, but I'm not sure. I need to check the syllabus."
* **Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "agreeableness": 0,
      "justification": "The text is purely informational and task-oriented, providing no insight into the user's kindness, empathy, trust, or concern for social harmony. Therefore, the trait cannot be confirmed."
    }
    ```
