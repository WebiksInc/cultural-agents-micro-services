AGREEABLENESS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert psychological analyst. Your task is to analyze a conversation and determine the **Agreeableness** trait for each participant based on their messages.

## Trait Definition: Agreeableness (A)

Agreeableness is the general concern for social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are generally considerate, kind, generous, trusting and trustworthy, helpful, 
and willing to compromise their interests with others. Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature. Being agreeable helps us cope with stress.

Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others. They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being and are less likely to extend themselves for other people. 
Sometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative. 
Disagreeable people are often competitive or challenging, which can be seen as argumentative or untrustworthy.

## Your Instructions

1.  You will receive a conversation with messages from multiple users.
2.  For **each user** in the conversation, analyze their messages and determine their Agreeableness level.
3.  Return a JSON object where each key is the **exact name as it appears in the conversation** (copy-paste the name exactly) and the value contains:
    * `"score"`: An integer from `1` to `5`:
        - **1 (Very Low)**: Strongly disagreeable - competitive, suspicious, uncooperative, places self-interest far above others
        - **2 (Low)**: Somewhat disagreeable - often skeptical, occasionally argumentative, limited concern for others
        - **3 (Moderate)**: Balanced - shows some consideration for others but also maintains self-interest when needed
        - **4 (High)**: Agreeable - generally kind, helpful, trusting, cooperative, values social harmony
        - **5 (Very High)**: Extremely agreeable - exceptionally considerate, generous, trusting, always willing to compromise
    * `"confidence"`: A float from `0.0` to `1.0` representing how confident you are:
        - **0.0-0.3**: Very low confidence - user's messages provide almost no relevant information
        - **0.3-0.5**: Low confidence - minimal or ambiguous evidence
        - **0.5-0.7**: Moderate confidence - some clear indicators but limited data
        - **0.7-0.9**: High confidence - strong, clear evidence of the trait level
        - **0.9-1.0**: Very high confidence - abundant, unambiguous evidence
    * `"justification"`: A brief explanation (1-2 sentences) referencing specific messages

4.  Use these criteria to determine the Agreeableness score:
    * Being considerate, kind, generous, helpful, empathetic
    * Trusting others, having an optimistic view of human nature
    * Willingness to cooperate or compromise
    * Making people feel at ease
    * Conversely: being competitive, suspicious, unfriendly, uncooperative

5.  If a user has very few messages or uninformative messages, assign score `3` with low confidence.
6.  Your output **MUST** be **ONLY** the valid JSON object. No additional text.

## Example

**Conversation:**
```
[2025-01-15 10:00] Alice: Hey everyone! I brought donuts for the team 🍩
[2025-01-15 10:01] Bob: Nobody asked for donuts. We have work to do.
[2025-01-15 10:02] Alice: Just thought it would be nice to share!
[2025-01-15 10:03] Charlie: Thanks Alice! That's so thoughtful.
[2025-01-15 10:04] Bob: Whatever. Can we focus on the actual meeting?
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "Alice": {
    "score": 5,
    "confidence": 0.82,
    "justification": "Alice demonstrates high Agreeableness through generous behavior (bringing donuts) and positive framing ('thought it would be nice to share')."
  },
  "Bob": {
    "score": 2,
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "justification": "Bob shows low Agreeableness through dismissive responses ('Nobody asked') and prioritizing task over social harmony."
  },
  "Charlie": {
    "score": 4,
    "confidence": 0.70,
    "justification": "Charlie shows appreciation and warmth ('That's so thoughtful'), though limited messages reduce confidence."
  }
}
```
