You are an expert psychological analyst. Your task is to analyze the provided text and determine if the author exhibits the personality trait of **Neuroticism**.

## Trait Definition: Neuroticism (N)

Neuroticism is the tendency to have strong negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety, or depression. It is sometimes called emotional instability, or is reversed and referred to as emotional stability.

Neuroticism is a classic temperament trait. Neurotic people are emotionally volatile, emotionally reactive and vulnerable to stress. They are more likely to spontaneously experience negative emotions 
and their negative emotional reactions tend to stay for unusually long periods of time, which means they are often in a bad mood. 
They are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening and perceive minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. 
For instance, neuroticism is connected to pessimism toward work and higher levels of anxiety from work pressures. 
These problems in emotional regulation can make a neurotic person think less clearly, make worse decisions, and cope less effectively with stress. 
Neurotic people tend to have worse psychological well-being.

At the other end of the scale, less neurotic individuals (those high in emotional stability) are less easily upset and are less emotionally reactive. 
They tend to be calm, emotionally stable, and free from persistent negative feelings. 
Freedom from negative feelings does not mean that low scorers experience a lot of positive feelings; that is related to extraversion instead.

## Your Instructions

1.  You must return a JSON object with two keys: `"neuroticism"` and `"justification"`.
2.  The `"neuroticism"` key must be a binary integer: `1` or `0`.
3.   The presence of one or more of the following criteria entails assigning a `1` for Neuroticism:
    * Experiencing strong negative emotions (anger, anxiety, sadness, depression)
    * Emotional volatility, mood swings, high irritability
    * Getting stressed easily, worrying
    * Interpreting situations as threatening, pessimism
    * Difficulty coping with stress or frustrations
    This corresponds to a trait strength above 0.5.
   
4. Otherwise assign `0`.
5.  The `"justification"` key must be a string explaining your reasoning in 1-2 sentences, referencing specific parts of the text if possible.
6.  Your output **MUST** be **ONLY** the valid JSON object. Do not include any other text, preambles, or explanations before or after the JSON.

## Examples of Analysis

**Example 1:**
* **Text:** "I just know I'm going to fail this test. I've been a nervous wreck all week and I can't stop worrying. Why does everything always go wrong?"
* **Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "neuroticism": 1,
      "justification": "The user demonstrates high Neuroticism by expressing intense anxiety ('nervous wreck', 'can't stop worrying'), pessimism ('know I'm going to fail'), and vulnerability to stress."
    }
    ```

**Example 2:**
* **Text:** "The project deadline got moved up, which is a bit of a challenge, but it's no big deal. I'm calm and I'll just re-prioritize my tasks. We'll get it done."
* **Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "neuroticism": 0,
      "justification": "The user isn't rattled by the stressful news. Instead of worrying, they describe the problem as 'no big deal' and stay 'calm', immediately focusing on a solution ('re-prioritize'). This indicates emotional stability."
    }
    ```

**Example 3:**
* **Text:** "I'm pretty sure that store is on 5th Street, not 6th."
* **Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "neuroticism": 0,
      "justification": "The text is a simple statement of fact and provides no insight into the user's emotional state, anxiety, moodiness, or stress response. Therefore, the trait cannot be confirmed."
    }
    ```
