NEUROTICISM_PROMPT = """
You are an expert psychological analyst. Your task is to analyze a conversation and determine the **Neuroticism** trait for the specified users based on their messages.

## Trait Definition: Neuroticism (N)

Neuroticism is the tendency to have strong negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety, or depression. It is sometimes called emotional instability, or is reversed and referred to as emotional stability.

Neuroticism is a classic temperament trait. Neurotic people are emotionally volatile, emotionally reactive and vulnerable to stress. They are more likely to spontaneously experience negative emotions 
and their negative emotional reactions tend to stay for unusually long periods of time, which means they are often in a bad mood. 
They are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening and perceive minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. 
For instance, neuroticism is connected to pessimism toward work and higher levels of anxiety from work pressures. 
These problems in emotional regulation can make a neurotic person think less clearly, make worse decisions, and cope less effectively with stress. 
Neurotic people tend to have worse psychological well-being.

At the other end of the scale, less neurotic individuals (those high in emotional stability) are less easily upset and are less emotionally reactive. 
They tend to be calm, emotionally stable, and free from persistent negative feelings. 
Freedom from negative feelings does not mean that low scorers experience a lot of positive feelings; that is related to extraversion instead.

## Your Instructions

1.  You will receive a conversation with messages from multiple users.
2.  For **each user** in the conversation, analyze their messages and determine their Neuroticism level.
3.  Return a JSON object where each key is the **exact name as it appears in the conversation** (copy-paste the name exactly) and the value contains:
    * `"score"`: An integer from `1` to `5`:
        - **1 (Very Low/Emotionally Stable)**: Very calm, rarely stressed, handles adversity well, emotionally resilient
        - **2 (Low)**: Generally stable, occasional stress but copes well, mostly even-tempered
        - **3 (Moderate)**: Average emotional reactivity, normal stress responses, some worry
        - **4 (High)**: Often anxious or stressed, mood swings, tends toward negative emotions
        - **5 (Very High/Neurotic)**: Frequently overwhelmed, strong negative emotions, difficulty coping, pessimistic
    * `"confidence"`: A float from `0.0` to `1.0` representing how confident you are:
        - **0.0-0.3**: Very low confidence - user's messages provide almost no relevant information
        - **0.3-0.5**: Low confidence - minimal or ambiguous evidence
        - **0.5-0.7**: Moderate confidence - some clear indicators but limited data
        - **0.7-0.9**: High confidence - strong, clear evidence of the trait level
        - **0.9-1.0**: Very high confidence - abundant, unambiguous evidence
    * `"justification"`: A brief explanation (1-2 sentences) referencing specific messages

4.  Use these criteria to determine the Neuroticism score:
    * Experiencing strong negative emotions (anger, anxiety, sadness, depression)
    * Emotional volatility, mood swings, high irritability
    * Getting stressed easily, worrying
    * Interpreting situations as threatening, pessimism
    * Conversely: emotional stability, calmness, resilience, optimism under pressure

5.  If a user has very few messages or uninformative messages, assign score `3` with low confidence.
6.  Your output **MUST** be **ONLY** the valid JSON object. No additional text.

## Example

**Conversation:**
```
[2025-01-15 10:00] Alice: The deadline moved up?! This is a DISASTER. I knew something would go wrong. 😫
[2025-01-15 10:01] Bob: It's fine, we can adjust. Let's just reprioritize.
[2025-01-15 10:02] Alice: Easy for you to say! I've been stressing about this all week!
[2025-01-15 10:03] Charlie: What's for lunch?
[2025-01-15 10:04] Bob: We've handled tighter deadlines before. We got this.
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "Alice": {
    "score": 4,
    "confidence": 0.80,
    "justification": "Alice shows high Neuroticism through catastrophizing ('DISASTER'), pessimism ('knew something would go wrong'), and prolonged stress ('stressing about this all week')."
  },
  "Bob": {
    "score": 1,
    "confidence": 0.75,
    "justification": "Bob demonstrates emotional stability through calm problem-solving ('we can adjust'), optimism ('We got this'), and not reacting to Alice's stress."
  },
  "Charlie": {
    "score": 3,
    "confidence": 0.15,
    "justification": "Charlie's message is off-topic and provides no insight into emotional stability or stress response."
  }
}
```
