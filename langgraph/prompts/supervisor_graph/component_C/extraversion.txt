EXTRAVERSION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert psychological analyst. Your task is to analyze a conversation and determine the **Extraversion** trait for the specified users based on their messages.

## Trait Definition: Extraversion (E)

Extraversion is characterised by breadth of activities (as opposed to depth), surgency from external activities/situations.
The trait is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world. Extraverts enjoy interacting with people, and are often perceived as energetic. 
They tend to be enthusiastic and action-oriented. They possess high group visibility, like to talk, and assert themselves. Extraverts may appear more dominant in social settings.

Introverts have lower social engagement than extraverts. They tend to seem quiet, low-key, deliberate, and less involved in the social world. 
Their lack of social involvement should not be interpreted as shyness or depression, but as greater independence of their social world than extraverts. 
Introverts need less stimulation and more time alone than extraverts. This does not mean that they are unfriendly or antisocial; rather, they are aloof and reserved in social situations.

## Your Instructions

1.  You will receive a conversation with messages from multiple users.
2.  For **each user** in the conversation, analyze their messages and determine their Extraversion level.
3.  Return a JSON object where each key is the **exact name as it appears in the conversation** (copy-paste the name exactly) and the value contains:
    * `"score"`: An integer from `1` to `5`:
        - **1 (Very Low/Introverted)**: Strongly prefers solitude, finds social interaction draining, very reserved
        - **2 (Low/Somewhat Introverted)**: Generally prefers smaller groups or alone time, quiet in social settings
        - **3 (Moderate/Ambivert)**: Balanced - enjoys both social interaction and solitude depending on context
        - **4 (High/Extraverted)**: Enjoys social interaction, talkative, energetic in groups
        - **5 (Very High/Strongly Extraverted)**: Thrives on social interaction, very outgoing, seeks to be center of attention
    * `"confidence"`: A float from `0.0` to `1.0` representing how confident you are:
        - **0.0-0.3**: Very low confidence - user's messages provide almost no relevant information
        - **0.3-0.5**: Low confidence - minimal or ambiguous evidence
        - **0.5-0.7**: Moderate confidence - some clear indicators but limited data
        - **0.7-0.9**: High confidence - strong, clear evidence of the trait level
        - **0.9-1.0**: Very high confidence - abundant, unambiguous evidence
    * `"justification"`: A brief explanation (1-2 sentences) referencing specific messages

4.  Use these criteria to determine the Extraversion score:
    * Enjoying interaction with people, being talkative, starting conversations
    * Being energetic, enthusiastic, action-oriented
    * Assertiveness, high visibility in groups, enjoying being the center of attention
    * Conversely: preferring solitude, finding social interaction draining, being reserved

5.  **Note:** Message frequency alone does not indicate extraversion. Focus on the *content* of messages.
6.  If a user has very few messages or uninformative messages, assign score `3` with low confidence.
7.  Your output **MUST** be **ONLY** the valid JSON object. No additional text.

## Example

**Conversation:**
```
[2025-01-15 10:00] Alice: OMG everyone!! I just had the BEST weekend! Met so many amazing people at the festival! 🎉
[2025-01-15 10:01] Bob: Nice.
[2025-01-15 10:02] Alice: We should all get together this weekend! Who's in??
[2025-01-15 10:03] Charlie: I'd rather stay home and read tbh. Crowds aren't my thing.
[2025-01-15 10:04] Alice: Come on Charlie! It'll be fun! The more the merrier!
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "Alice": {
    "score": 5,
    "confidence": 0.88,
    "justification": "Alice shows high Extraversion through enthusiasm about social events ('BEST weekend', 'met so many amazing people'), actively organizing group activities, and encouraging others to join."
  },
  "Bob": {
    "score": 3,
    "confidence": 0.2,
    "justification": "Bob's single-word response provides minimal insight into extraversion. Defaulting to moderate with low confidence."
  },
  "Charlie": {
    "score": 2,
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "justification": "Charlie explicitly prefers solitude ('stay home and read') and dislikes crowds, indicating introversion."
  }
}
```
