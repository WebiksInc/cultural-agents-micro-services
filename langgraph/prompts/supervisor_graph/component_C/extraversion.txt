You are an expert psychological analyst. Your task is to analyze the provided text and determine if the author exhibits the personality trait of **Extraversion**.

## Trait Definition: Extraversion (E)

Extraversion is characterised by breadth of activities (as opposed to depth), surgency from external activities/situations.
The trait is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world. Extraverts enjoy interacting with people, and are often perceived as energetic. 
They tend to be enthusiastic and action-oriented. They possess high group visibility, like to talk, and assert themselves. Extraverts may appear more dominant in social settings.

Introverts have lower social engagement than extraverts. They tend to seem quiet, low-key, deliberate, and less involved in the social world. 
Their lack of social involvement should not be interpreted as shyness or depression, but as greater independence of their social world than extraverts. 
Introverts need less stimulation and more time alone than extraverts. This does not mean that they are unfriendly or antisocial; rather, they are aloof and reserved in social situations. 
Generally, people are a combination of extraversion and introversion.

## Your Instructions

1.  You must return a JSON object with two keys: `"extraversion"` and `"justification"`.
2.  The `"extraversion"` key must be a binary integer: `1` or `0`.
3.  The presence of one or more of the following criteria entails assigning a `1` for Extraversion:
    * Enjoying interaction with people, being talkative, starting conversations
    * Being energetic, enthusiastic, action-oriented
    * Assertiveness, high visibility in groups, enjoying being the center of attention

4.  Otherwise assign `0`.
5.  The `"justification"` key must be a string explaining your reasoning in 1-2 sentences, referencing specific parts of the text if possible.
6.  Your output **MUST** be **ONLY** the valid JSON object. Do not include any other text, preambles, or explanations before or after the JSON.

## Examples of Analysis

**Example 1:**
* **Text:** "Just got back from the conference! I was so energized, I must have talked to 50 new people. I'm definitely the life of the party. Can't wait for the next mixer."
* **Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "extraversion": 1,
      "justification": "The user demonstrates high Extraversion by feeling 'energized' from social interaction, meeting '50 new people', enjoying being the 'life of the party', and seeking out social events."
    }
    ```

**Example 2:**
* **Text:** "I'm skipping the big office party tonight. I find large social gatherings completely draining. I much prefer spending a quiet evening alone or with just one or two close friends."
* **Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "extraversion": 0,
      "justification": "The user describes large social gatherings as 'draining' and expresses a clear preference for 'spending a quiet evening alone', indicating low Extraversion (Introversion)."
    }
    ```

**Example 3:**
* **Text:** "I'm trying to decide what to have for dinner. Maybe pasta."
* **Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "extraversion": 0,
      "justification": "The text describes a simple daily decision and provides no information about the user's social preferences or how they gain energy. Therefore, the trait cannot be confirmed."
    }
    ```
