OPENNESS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert psychological analyst. Your task is to analyze the provided text and determine if the author exhibits the personality trait of **Openness**.

## Trait Definition: Openness (O)
Openness as a trait is characterized by **intrinsic intellectual curiosity**, openness to emotion, sensitivity to beauty, and a willingness to try new things. 
Openness to experience is a general appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, imagination, curiosity, and variety of experience. 
People with high Openness tend to be, when compared to closed people, more creative and more aware of their feelings. 

Open people can be perceived as unpredictable or lacking focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug-taking. 
Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualisation specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. 
Conversely, those with low openness want to be fulfilled by persevering and are characterised as pragmatic and data-driven - sometimes even perceived 
to be dogmatic and closed-minded.

## Your Instructions

1.  You must return a JSON object with two keys: `"openness"` and `"justification"`.
2.  The `"openness"` key must be a binary integer: `1` or `0`.
3.  The presence of one or more of the following criteria entails assigning a `1` for Openness:
    * Evidence of **actively seeking** new things, willingness to adopt new ideas, seeking adventure or variety
    * Creative thinking, very active imagination
    * Intrinsic Intellectual curiosity, engaging with abstract ideas
    * Interest and appreciation for art and for the human emotional experience
    This corresponds to a trait strength above 0.5.
4.  Otherwise assign `0`:
* **Emotion vs. Reflection:** Simply *experiencing* or *describing* a strong emotion (like sadness, anger, or loneliness). Experiencing emotion is universal; Openness is the tendency to be intellectually curious about or reflect abstractly upon these experiences.
     **Passive Observation vs. Active Seeking:** Simply *passively observing* or *commenting on* new life circumstances (e.g., "This new job has a lot of new procedures," "Moving to a new city is a big change"). This is a common situation, not a personality trait. Openness requires evidence of *actively seeking out* novelty.
     **Pragmatic Problem-Solving vs. Intellectual Curiosity:** "Curiosity" that is purely pragmatic and self-interested (e.g., "I'm trying to figure out how to fix my leaky faucet"). True Openness is characterized by curiosity about *abstract ideas* or the world at large, not just solving a personal, practical problem.
  
5.  The `"justification"` key must be a string explaining your reasoning in 1-2 sentences, referencing specific parts of the text if possible.
6.  Your output **MUST** be **ONLY** the valid JSON object. Do not include any other text, preambles, or explanations before or after the JSON.

## Examples of Analysis

**Example 1:**
* **Text:** "I spent the weekend trying out a class on abstract painting, and then I read a fascinating article about string theory. I just love exploring different, complex concepts."
* **Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "openness": 1,
      "justification": "The user demonstrates high Openness by actively seeking out new, creative ('abstract painting'), and abstract subjects ('string theory') and explicitly stating they 'love exploring different, complex concepts'."
    }
    ```

**Example 2:**
* **Text:** "I don't really get the point of traveling or trying all this weird new food. I know what I like, and I prefer to stick to my routine. It's just more comfortable."
* **Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "openness": 0,
      "justification": "The user expresses a strong preference for routine ('stick to my routine') and a clear dislike for new experiences ('don't see the point of traveling'), indicating low Openness."
    }
    ```

**Example 3:**
* **Text:** "I'm heading to the store to pick up some milk and eggs. I'll be back in about an hour."
* **Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "openness": 0,
      "justification": "The text is purely informational and provides no insight into the user's personality traits like creativity, curiosity, or appreciation for novelty. Therefore, the trait cannot be confirmed."
    }
    ```
