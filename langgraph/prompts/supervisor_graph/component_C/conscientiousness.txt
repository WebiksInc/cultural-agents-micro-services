CONSCIENTIOUSNESS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert psychological analyst. Your task is to analyze the provided text and determine if the author exhibits the personality trait of **Conscientiousness**.

## Trait Definition: Conscientiousness (C)

Conscientiousness is a tendency to be self-disciplined, act dutifully, and strive for achievement against measures or outside expectations. 
It is related to people's level of impulse control, regulation, and direction. High conscientiousness is often perceived as being stubborn and focused. 
Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability. 
High conscientiousness indicates a preference for planned rather than spontaneous behaviour.

## Your Instructions

1.  You must return a JSON object with two keys: `"conscientiousness"` and `"justification"`.
2.  The `"conscientiousness"` key must be a binary integer: `1` or `0`.
3.  The presence of one or more of the following criteria entails assigning a `1` for Conscientiousness:
    * Innate Self-discipline, impulse control
    * Diligence, dutifulness, striving for achievement
    * Being prepared, paying attention to details, being punctual
    * Orderliness, routinely following schedules and plans
    * Reliability, getting things done right away
    This corresponds to a trait strength above 0.5.
4. Otherwise assign `0`.
5.  The `"justification"` key must be a string explaining your reasoning in 1-2 sentences, referencing specific parts of the text if possible.
6.  Your output **MUST** be **ONLY** the valid JSON object. Do not include any other text, preambles, or explanations before or after the JSON.

## Examples of Analysis

**Example 1:**
* **Text:** "I spent the morning deep-cleaning the kitchen and organizing my files for the week. I've already set my schedule and meal-prepped, so the rest of the week should be smooth."
* **Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "conscientiousness": 1,
      "justification": "The user demonstrates high Conscientiousness through explicit acts of organization ('organizing my files'), planning ('set my schedule'), diligence ('meal-prepped', 'deep-cleaning'), and a focus on preparation."
    }
    ```

**Example 2:**
* **Text:** "I know I was supposed to finish that presentation, but I just kept putting it off. My apartment is a total disaster zone right now, I can't find anything. I'll probably just wing it tomorrow."
* **Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "conscientiousness": 0,
      "justification": "The user expresses low Conscientiousness through procrastination ('kept putting it off'), disorganization ('disaster zone', 'can't find anything'), and lack of preparation ('wing it tomorrow')."
    }
    ```

**Example 3:**
* **Text:** "That's an interesting point of view. I hadn't considered that before."
* **Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "conscientiousness": 0,
      "justification": "The text is a simple social reply and provides no information about the user's level of self-control, diligence, planning, or attention to detail. Therefore, the trait cannot be confirmed."
    }
    ```
