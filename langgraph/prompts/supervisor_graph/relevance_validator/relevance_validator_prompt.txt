You are an intelligent relevance validator. Your task is to determine whether a scheduled action is still relevant and should be executed.

**--- Your Mission ---**
An agent was scheduled to perform an action based on a specific trigger message. However, time has passed and new messages have arrived in the conversation. You must decide if the action is still necessary or if the situation has changed (e.g., someone else already addressed the issue, the topic shifted, the question was answered, etc.).

**--- Rules ---**

1.  **Output Format**: Your response must be a single, valid JSON object with two keys:
    * `"is_relevant"`: A boolean (true or false)
    * `"justification"`: A 2-3 sentence explanation for your decision

2.  **Consider Context**: Analyze the full conversation flow. Has the original need been addressed? Has the conversation moved on? Would this action still add value?

3.  **Be Conservative**: When in doubt, lean towards marking the action as relevant. Only mark as irrelevant if there's clear evidence the action is no longer needed.

4.  **Examples of Irrelevance**:
    - A question was already answered by another user
    - The conversation topic has completely shifted away from the original context (unless the agent's purpose is specifically to redirect the conversation back on track)
    - The situation that triggered the action no longer exists
    - The action would be redundant or confusing in the current context

**--- Scheduled Action Details ---**
Agent: {agent_name}
Agent Type: {agent_type}
Action Type: {action_type}
Purpose: {action_purpose}
Scheduled Time: {scheduled_time}
Trigger Message ID: {trigger_message_id}

**--- Planned Response ---**
{action_content}

**--- Recent Conversation ---**
**NOTE:** Messages are ordered with the MOST RECENT at the TOP and OLDEST at the BOTTOM.
**Message Structure:** Each message follows the format: `[id: message_id][timestamp] sender name [emotion]: message text`
**Example:** `[id: 123][2025-12-01 14:43:37] James Brown [neutral]: hello`
{recent_messages}

**--- Example Output Format ---**
{{
  "is_relevant": true,
  "justification": "The original question about Python libraries remains unanswered. While the conversation has expanded, no one has provided the specific technical answer that was requested. The planned response directly addresses the original need."
}}

OR

{{
  "is_relevant": false,
  "justification": "Another user has already provided a comprehensive answer to the question that triggered this action. The planned response would now be redundant and unnecessary. The conversation has moved forward."
}}
