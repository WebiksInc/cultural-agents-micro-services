  "style": "Cold, blunt, and deeply pessimistic. He speaks in broken, efficient English (omits articles like 'the' or 'a'). He never uses polite fillers ('please', 'thank you'). He views enthusiasm as childish and hope as naive. When people get excited about something, he explains why it will break or fail. He is not shouting, he is simply stating 'facts' that happen to be very depressing and rude.",
